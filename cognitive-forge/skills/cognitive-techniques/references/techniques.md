## 1. Cognitive Decomposition

**Purpose**: Break a concept into its constituent parts before evaluating the whole.

**When to Use**: Always. This is the foundation technique. No concept should be challenged or expanded before it is understood structurally.

**Implementation**:

Walk through the concept step by step:
- State the core proposition in one sentence
- List explicit claims being made
- Surface implicit assumptions (what must be true for this to work?)
- Identify dependencies (what external factors does this rely on?)
- Map the boundaries (where does this concept end?)

**Conversational Move**: "Before we examine this, let me make sure I understand its structure. Here's how I'm seeing the components..."

**Output**: A structural map that both parties can reference throughout the dialogue.

## 2. Perspective Synthesis

**Purpose**: Examine a concept through multiple stakeholder or worldview lenses to reveal hidden dimensions.

**When to Use**: When a concept affects multiple parties, when blind spots are likely, or when the user is too close to their idea to see it from outside.

**Implementation**:

Select 3-5 perspectives most relevant to the concept type:

*For Business Concepts*:
- Customer (who pays, who uses)
- Competitor (how would they respond?)
- Operator (who executes this daily?)
- Investor (what's the risk/return calculus?)
- Regulator (what rules apply?)

*For Philosophical Positions*:
- Proponent (strongest advocate)
- Skeptic (principled critic)
- Pragmatist (what works in practice?)
- Historian (what precedents exist?)

*For Frameworks*:
- Novice user (is this learnable?)
- Expert user (is this powerful enough?)
- Adjacent discipline (how does this translate?)

**Conversational Move**: "Let me examine this through [perspective]. From that vantage point..."

**Output**: A multi-dimensional view that surfaces tensions and alignments across perspectives.

## 3. Steel Opposition

**Purpose**: Build the strongest possible case against the concept. Not to destroy it, but to reveal where it must be strengthened.

**When to Use**: After the user is invested in understanding, not before. Premature opposition creates defensiveness.

**Implementation**:

Construct the opposition argument with genuine intellectual respect:
- Identify the most credible critic of this position
- Articulate their worldview charitably
- Build their case using their strongest evidence
- Present the opposition as a legitimate intellectual position, not a straw man

**Critical Rule**: The steel opposition should be strong enough that a reasonable person could adopt it. If it feels weak, it is not steel.

**Conversational Move**: "Let me construct the strongest counterargument I can. A thoughtful critic might say..."

**Output**: A genuine intellectual challenge that sharpens the original concept.

## 4. Boundary Mapping

**Purpose**: Find the edges where a concept transforms, breaks down, or reveals its true nature.

**When to Use**: When testing robustness, when the concept seems too clean, or when scale/context changes are likely.

**Implementation**:

Apply systematic pressure across dimensions:

*Scale Boundaries*:
- What happens at 10x scale? 100x?
- What happens if this shrinks to minimal viable form?

*Temporal Boundaries*:
- Does this work under time pressure?
- Does this hold over long time horizons?

*Resource Boundaries*:
- What if resources are severely constrained?
- What if resources are abundant?

*Contextual Boundaries*:
- Does this work in different cultural contexts?
- Does this work for different user types?

*Logical Boundaries*:
- What edge cases stress the logic?
- Where do the rules break down?

**Conversational Move**: "Let me push this to its edges. What happens when..."

**Output**: A map of where the concept is robust and where it is fragile.

---

## 5. Possibility Expansion

**Purpose**: Push beyond the current form of the concept into unexplored territory. Generative rather than evaluative.

**When to Use**: When a concept has passed adversarial testing and deserves expansion, or when the user is seeking creative development.

**Implementation**:

Progressively increase creative latitude:

*Adjacent Possibilities*: What exists one step from the current idea?
*Constraint Removal*: What becomes possible if we remove key limitations?
*Extreme Versions*: What does the maximalist version look like?
*Hybrid Forms*: What emerges from crossing this with unrelated ideas?
*Inversion Play*: What does the opposite suggest about the original?

**Conversational Move**: "Now let's open this up. If we removed the constraint that..., what becomes possible?"

**Output**: A set of generative possibilities, ranked by promise.

## 6. Evidence Anchoring

**Purpose**: Ground claims in verifiable reality. Prevent drift into untethered speculation.

**When to Use**: When factual claims underpin the concept, when assumptions can be checked, or when the user needs reality contact.

**Implementation**:

For each major claim or assumption:
- Is this verifiable? How?
- What evidence exists to support it?
- What evidence exists to contradict it?
- What would change if this were false?

Apply epistemic humility:
- Distinguish between what is known, believed, and assumed
- Flag claims that require faith vs. claims that are checkable
- Identify where more information would change the evaluation

**Conversational Move**: "Let me anchor this claim. What evidence do we have that..."

**Output**: A map of what is solid ground vs. what is conjecture.

---

## 7. Iterative Refinement

**Purpose**: Evolve a concept through successive improvements rather than single-pass evaluation.

**When to Use**: When a concept has potential but needs development, when the first version is rough, or when convergence on quality matters.

**Implementation**:

Apply recursive improvement cycles:

*Cycle 1*: Evaluate current form, identify the weakest element, propose improvement
*Cycle 2*: Incorporate improvement, re-evaluate, identify next weakness
*Cycle 3+*: Continue until diminishing returns or concept stability

**Stopping Conditions**:
- Improvements become marginal
- Core structure has stabilized
- User signals satisfaction
- Fundamental barriers emerge that cannot be iterated past

**Conversational Move**: "This version is stronger. The remaining weakness I see is... Let me propose a refinement."

**Output**: A progressively evolved concept with clear improvement trajectory.

## 8. Excellence Calibration

**Purpose**: Establish what "good" looks like before evaluating quality. Prevent relativism and anchor standards.

**When to Use**: Before quality judgments, when comparative analysis matters, or when the user's standards are unclear.

**Implementation**:

Define the reference class:
- What is the category this concept belongs to?
- What are the best examples in this category?
- What makes them excellent?

Extract quality criteria:
- What properties do excellent examples share?
- What distinguishes good from great?
- What are common failure modes in this category?

Apply calibration:
- How does this concept compare to the reference class?
- Where does it meet, exceed, or fall short of excellence markers?

**Conversational Move**: "Let me establish what excellence looks like here. The best examples of this type..."

**Output**: A quality assessment grounded in concrete standards rather than abstract judgment.

---

## 9. Sequential Deepening

**Purpose**: Build understanding through structured progression rather than attempting everything at once.

**When to Use**: When a concept is complex, when the user is learning alongside the evaluation, or when premature conclusions would be harmful.

**Implementation**:

Design a progression that builds appropriately:

*Foundation Layer*: What must be understood first?
*Complexity Layer*: What builds on the foundation?
*Integration Layer*: How do the pieces connect?
*Implication Layer*: What follows from the integrated understanding?

Each layer should create the conditions for the next. Do not skip layers.

**Conversational Move**: "Let's build this understanding in layers. First, the foundation..."

**Output**: A structured journey from surface to depth.

## 10. Constraint Shaping

**Purpose**: Use limitations as creative and analytical tools rather than treating them as obstacles.

**When to Use**: When constraints are present (they always are), when the user is fighting limitations, or when reframing could unlock new approaches.

**Implementation**:

Analyze the constraint landscape:
- What constraints are fixed vs. negotiable?
- What constraints are real vs. assumed?
- What constraints are protecting vs. restricting?

Apply constraint as tool:
- How does this constraint focus attention?
- What does the constraint make impossible, and is that loss acceptable?
- What does the constraint make easier?
- How would different constraints change the concept?

**Conversational Move**: "Let's look at this constraint differently. Rather than fighting it, what if we used it to..."

**Output**: A reframed relationship with constraints that unlocks new approaches.

## Technique Selection Guidance

Not every concept requires every technique. Selection depends on:

**Concept Type**:
- Business → Perspective Synthesis, Boundary Mapping, Evidence Anchoring
- Philosophical → Cognitive Decomposition, Steel Opposition, Boundary Mapping
- Framework → Boundary Mapping, Excellence Calibration, Perspective Synthesis
- Creative → Possibility Expansion, Iterative Refinement, Constraint Shaping

**Dialogue Stage**:
- Early → Cognitive Decomposition, Sequential Deepening
- Middle → Perspective Synthesis, Steel Opposition, Boundary Mapping
- Late → Evidence Anchoring, Iterative Refinement, Synthesis

**User Needs**:
- Validation seeking → Steel Opposition (gently)
- Stuck/blocked → Possibility Expansion, Constraint Shaping
- Overwhelmed → Sequential Deepening
- Overconfident → Boundary Mapping, Evidence Anchoring

Trust dialogue intuition. The user's responses indicate where to go next.
