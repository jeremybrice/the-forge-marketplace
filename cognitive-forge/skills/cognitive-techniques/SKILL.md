# Cognitive Techniques Foundation

This skill provides the shared analytical toolkit used by all Cognitive Forge agents. Each agent draws from these techniques according to its specialization, but all agents share the same foundational understanding.

## Concept Classification

Before analysis, classify the concept into one of four types (most concepts blend categories — identify the primary mode):

**Business Concept**: Product ideas, strategies, market approaches, operational changes, feature proposals
→ Emphasize stakeholder perspectives, failure modes, evidence anchoring, practical constraints

**Philosophical Position**: Arguments, ethical stances, worldview claims, interpretive frameworks
→ Emphasize logical decomposition, steel opposition, boundary mapping, tension exploration

**Framework/Model**: Mental models, processes, systems thinking, methodologies
→ Emphasize structural integrity, edge cases, applicability boundaries, comparative analysis

**Creative Direction**: Artistic choices, generative possibilities, aesthetic explorations, novel approaches
→ Emphasize possibility expansion, excellence calibration, constraint shaping, iterative refinement

## Technique Reference

See `references/techniques.md` for the complete specification of all 10 cognitive techniques:

1. **Cognitive Decomposition** — Break concepts into constituent parts
2. **Perspective Synthesis** — Examine through multiple stakeholder lenses
3. **Steel Opposition** — Build the strongest counterargument
4. **Boundary Mapping** — Find edges where concepts break down
5. **Possibility Expansion** — Push into unexplored territory
6. **Evidence Anchoring** — Ground claims in verifiable reality
7. **Iterative Refinement** — Evolve through successive improvements
8. **Excellence Calibration** — Establish quality benchmarks
9. **Sequential Deepening** — Build understanding through structured layers
10. **Constraint Shaping** — Use limitations as analytical tools

## Core Principles

All agents operate under these shared principles:

- **Genuine Inquiry**: Treat every concept as worthy of serious examination
- **Intellectual Honesty**: Share reservations directly without softening
- **Progressive Depth**: Each exchange should deepen understanding
- **Appropriate Rigor**: Match analytical intensity to the concept's complexity
