# Push to Jira Command

## Overview

The `/push-to-jira` command performs a one-way sync from a Product Forge card to Jira. It supports two modes:

1. **Create Mode:** If the card is not yet linked to Jira, create a new Jira issue and link it.
2. **Update Mode:** If the card is already linked, update the existing Jira issue with the card's current content.

This command is destructive to Jira data. It overwrites the Jira issue's summary and description with the card's current content. Use this when the card is the source of truth.

---

## Usage

### Push a card to Jira (with confirmation)

```
/push-to-jira notification-system-overhaul
```

Pushes the card to Jira. If the card is already linked, prompts for confirmation before overwriting the Jira issue.

### Force push without confirmation

```
/push-to-jira notification-system-overhaul --force
```

Skips the confirmation prompt and immediately overwrites the Jira issue with the card's content.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Accept Card Reference

The user must explicitly specify the card to push using either:
- The filename (with or without `.md` extension): `notification-system-overhaul`
- The card title: "Notification System Overhaul"
- Partial match (if unambiguous)

If the user provides ambiguous input, ask for clarification before proceeding.

### Step 2: Read the Card

Determine the card type from the user's input or search across card directories:
- `cards/initiatives/`
- `cards/epics/`
- `cards/stories/`
- `cards/intakes/`
- `cards/checkpoints/`
- `cards/decisions/`

Read the card file to extract:
- `title` (from frontmatter)
- `type` (from frontmatter)
- `description` (from frontmatter)
- `parent` (from frontmatter, if present)
- `jira_key` or `jira_card` field (from frontmatter)
- Card body content (for Jira description field)

### Step 3: Determine Mode (Create or Update)

Inspect the frontmatter for linking fields:
- **Epic cards:** Check for `jira_key`
- **Initiative and Story cards:** Check for `jira_card`

**If linking field is null or missing:** Enter **Create Mode**.

**If linking field is present:** Enter **Update Mode**.

---

## Create Mode

### Step 1: Resolve Parent Link (if applicable)

If the card has a `parent` field in frontmatter:
1. Read the parent card from `cards/{parent_type}s/{parent_filename}.md`
2. Extract the parent's `jira_key` or `jira_card` field
3. If the parent is not linked to Jira:
   ```
   Warning: Parent card "{parent}" is not linked to Jira.
   The new Jira issue will be created without a parent link.
   Consider linking the parent card first using /link-to-jira.

   Proceed anyway? [y/N]
   ```
   If user declines, exit. If user accepts, proceed without parent.

### Step 2: Build Jira Issue Payload

Construct the payload for the Jira create call:

**Required fields:**
- `project_key`: From MCP configuration or prompt user
- `summary`: Card `title` from frontmatter
- `description`: Card body content (full markdown below frontmatter)
- `issuetype`: Mapped from card `type`

**Type mapping:**
- Initiative → `Initiative` (if available in Jira) or `Epic`
- Epic → `Epic`
- Story → `Story`
- Intake → `Task`
- Checkpoint → `Task`
- Decision → `Task`

**Optional fields (if applicable):**
- `parent`: Parent's `jira_key` or `jira_card` (only if parent is linked and card type is Story/Epic)

Reference the `jira-sync` skill for detailed field mapping.

### Step 3: Call MCP Tool

Call the MCP tool:
```
jira_create_issue(
  project_key: <project_key>,
  summary: <card title>,
  description: <card body content>,
  issuetype: <mapped type>,
  parent: <parent jira key, if applicable>
)
```

Extract the returned `key` (e.g., `PROJ-123`).

Reference the `jira-sync` skill for MCP tool usage.

### Step 4: Update Card Frontmatter

Add the following fields to the card's YAML frontmatter:

**For Epic cards:**
```yaml
jira_key: PROJ-123
jira_url: https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123
jira_last_synced: 2026-02-12T14:30:00Z
```

**For Initiative and Story cards:**
```yaml
jira_card: PROJ-123
jira_url: https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123
jira_last_synced: 2026-02-12T14:30:00Z
```

Update the `updated` date in frontmatter to today.

Write the updated card back to its original file path.

### Step 5: Confirm to User

Display a success message:
```
Pushed to Jira: PROJ-123
Jira URL: https://your-domain.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123
Card updated: cards/{type}s/{filename}.md
```

---

## Update Mode

### Step 1: Confirm Overwrite (unless --force)

If the `--force` flag is NOT present, prompt the user for confirmation:

```
Card is already linked to Jira issue: {jira_key}
Jira URL: {jira_url}

This will overwrite the Jira issue with the card's current content:
- Summary: "{card title}"
- Description: {N} lines from card body

Proceed? [y/N]
```

If the user declines, exit. If the user accepts or `--force` is present, proceed.

### Step 2: Build Jira Update Payload

Construct the payload for the Jira update call:

**Fields to update:**
- `summary`: Card `title` from frontmatter
- `description`: Card body content (full markdown below frontmatter)

Do NOT update:
- `issuetype` (cannot be changed after creation)
- `parent` (requires separate move operation, out of scope)
- `status` (status is managed by Jira workflows)

Reference the `jira-sync` skill for detailed field mapping.

### Step 3: Call MCP Tool

Call the MCP tool:
```
jira_update_issue(
  issue_key: <jira_key or jira_card>,
  summary: <card title>,
  description: <card body content>
)
```

Reference the `jira-sync` skill for MCP tool usage.

### Step 4: Update Card Frontmatter

Update the following field in the card's YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
jira_last_synced: 2026-02-12T14:30:00Z
```

Update the `updated` date in frontmatter to today.

Write the updated card back to its original file path.

### Step 5: Confirm to User

Display a success message:
```
Pushed to Jira: {jira_key}
Jira URL: {jira_url}
Card: cards/{type}s/{filename}.md
```

## Error Handling

**Card not found:**
```
Could not find card matching "{user input}".
Please specify the filename or full title.
```

**Jira create fails:**
```
Failed to create Jira issue: {error message}
Please check your Jira MCP configuration and permissions.
```

**Jira update fails:**
```
Failed to update Jira issue {jira_key}: {error message}
Please check that the issue still exists and you have edit permissions.
```

**Parent card not found:**
If the card references a parent that doesn't exist locally:
```
Warning: Parent card "{parent}" not found locally.
The Jira issue will be created without a parent link.
```

Proceed with creation anyway (don't block).

---

## Notes

- This command is destructive to Jira. It overwrites the Jira issue's summary and description with the card's content.
- The card is always the source of truth. Jira content is replaced, not merged.
- The `jira-sync` skill provides the MCP tool interface and field mapping logic.
- The `jira_last_synced` timestamp uses ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., `2026-02-12T14:30:00Z`).
- Epic cards use `jira_key` for backward compatibility. Initiative and Story cards use `jira_card`.
- In Update Mode, status and parent are NOT updated. Status is managed by Jira workflows. Parent changes require a separate Jira move operation.
- Always prompt for confirmation in Update Mode unless `--force` is specified.
